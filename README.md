I initially used Python to program this SudokuSolver https://github.com/ObjectJosh/SudokuSolver and decided to create a visualization of the process in JavaScript. Of course, the visualization slows down the process of backtracking, so that you may see what's happening. In reality, the solving of this sudoku puzzle takes just miliseconds.
